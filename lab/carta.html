        </p>
        <h2> Starting dates </h2>
        <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you<br/> could star at the beginning of a semester; the star dates for each one are as follws:

            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017.</li>
        </ol>

        <p> Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br/></p>

        <p>You can find more information about
            <a href="" class="hipervio">important university dates</a> on our website.
        </p>

        <h2> Subjects of study </h2>
        <p> At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjetcts fall<br/>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated research, and just
            <br/> the kind of person we´d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br/>by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on perfomance of funk bassplayers at tempratures, exceending 30ºC (86ºF),when the <br/> audience size exponentially increases(effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)</li>
            <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scares.</li>
        </ul>

        <P> So please can you provide more information on each on each of these subjetcts, including how long you´d expect the<br/> research to take required stadd and other resources, and anything else you think we´need to know?Thanks.<br/>
        </P>
        <H2>Exotic dance moves</H2>

        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post -doctorate work, I did study exotuc tribal dances, To ansewer your question<br/> my favourite dances ares as fllows, with definitions:</p>

        <p>Polynesian chiken dance<br/>

            <div class="sangria"> A litle knov but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br/> in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".<br/>
            </div>

            Icelandic brownian shuffle<br/>
            <div class="sangria"> Before the Icelanders developed fire a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, whitch<br/> involved hudding close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably<br/> tiny. very rapid
                movements. One of my fellow students used to day that he thought this dance inspired
                <br/> modem styles such as Tweking.</div>
            Arcetic robot dance<br/>
            <div class="sangria">Am interesting example of historic misinformation , English explorers in the 1960 belived to have<br/> discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stiled movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br/> of Northern Alaska and Canada.
                Later om however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br/> because they were really cold.<br/>
            </div>
